# Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project predicts whether a patient will attend or miss their healthcare appointment using machine learning models.
It also provides insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**, helping hospitals optimize scheduling, reduce wasted resources, and improve patient care.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Predict patient no-shows using ML algorithms.
* Analyze factors affecting appointment attendance (age, gender, SMS reminders, neighborhood, weekday).
* Provide actionable insights with Power BI dashboards.
* Recommend strategies to reduce no-show rates.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

* **Python**: Data preprocessing & machine learning (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib).
* **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard creation.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Experimentation and model building.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Key Results

* **Best Threshold (Youdenâ€™s J):** 0.5861

* **Model Metrics:**

  * Accuracy: 61.7%
  * Sensitivity (Recall for No-show): 57.0%
  * Specificity: 80.2%
  * ROC-AUC: 0.686

* **Dashboard Insights:**

  * Total Appointments: 106,980
  * No-show Rate: 20.26%
  * Top Neighborhood with No-shows: *Jardim Camburi*
  * SMS reminders reduce but do not eliminate no-shows.
  * Highest no-shows on Mondays & Tuesdays.

---

## âœ… Deliverables

* Trained ML model (Decision Tree & XGBoost).
* Interactive **Power BI dashboard**.
* Final **2-page PDF report** with summary & recommendations.

## ðŸ“– Conclusion

This project shows that predictive modeling can help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and take preventive measures. Combining **machine learning + dashboard insights** supports data-driven scheduling and reduces operational inefficiencies.
